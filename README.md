# lockbox

Maintain an encrypted lockbox of data, accessible only by you.  Performs fast file-by-file encryption on every file in a directory recursively.  This script should be capable of running in macOS or in Linux.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JElchison/lockbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JElchison/lockbox)


## Features
* Performs fast file-by-file encryption on every file in a directory recursively
* Should be capable of running in macOS or in Linux
* Bash-based with minimal external dependencies (mainly OpenSSL's `enc` utility and `xxd`)
* Uses [NSA Suite B Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_Suite_B_Cryptography) algorithms with generally good cryptographic hygiene
* Skips all files that are not [regular files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types#Regular_file) (such as symbolic links)
* Skips all files that are not writable by current user (a la `find -writable`), to avoid accidentally encrypting OS files
* Encrypted (ciphertext) files consume exactly same space as original (plaintext) files.  No additional key/IV material needs to be stored on lockbox device.  Helpful when trying to maintain lockbox on storage device with little free space.
    * Same symmetrical key used for all files.  Avoids having to store individual keys on lockbox device.
    * IV dynamically calculated for each file.  Like an [ESSIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption_theory#Encrypted_salt-sector_initialization_vector_(ESSIV)), but uses hash of full file path instead of sector number.
* In-place encryption/decryption.  Instead of using a temp file on storage device for every encryption operation, an attempt is made to reuse existing [inode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode).  Helpful when trying to maintain lockbox on storage device with little free space.
    * Note:  The implication here is that you must be careful about version history and backups.  For example, it does no good to store your lockbox on Dropbox, since Dropbox will (forevermore) have plaintext versions of your encrypted files in its version history.
* Encrypted files leave little hint (if any) about what encrypted it
* (Recommended) use of manifest file verifies that all encrypted files (no more, no less) have been correctly decrypted to original state
* Local script can be run against remote lockbox, without local script ever existing on remote lockbox device
    * Still requires that remote lockbox device has OpenSSL's `enc` utility and `xxd` dependencies installed

Note:  This tool does not encrypt, rename, or otherwise attempt to mask the original (plaintext) filenames.  Thus, even when file contents are encrypted in the lockbox, it's still possible to see the original filenames.


## Environment
* Any OS having a Bash environment
* The following tools must be installed, executable, and in the PATH:
    * OpenSSL's `enc` utility
    * `xxd`


## Prerequisites
To install necessary prerequisites on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install coreutils openssl vim-common

LibreSSL is also acceptable.

To install necessary prerequisites on macOS:

    brew install coreutils findutils gnu-sed openssl


## Getting Started

To encrypt:

1. Use `gen_key.sh` to generate a new key.  Always generate a new key for each encryption.
2. Invoke `lockbox.sh` to recursively encrypt the directory you deem as your lockbox.
3. Save your generated key in a safe/secure place.

To decrypt:

1. Invoke `lockbox.sh` (with the key you previously saved) to decrypt your lockbox.


## Usage
```
Maintain an encrypted lockbox of data, accessible only by you.
Performs fast file-by-file encryption on every file in a directory recursively.

This script should be capable of running in macOS or in Linux.

Usage:  ./lockbox.sh (-e lockbox_dir|-d (manifest_file|lockbox_dir)) key
        ./lockbox.sh -v
        ./lockbox.sh -h
    -e lockbox_dir
        Encrypt mode.  Encrypts all files in lockbox_dir, recursively.
        Manifest file is written to stdout.
    -d manifest_file
        Decrypt mode.  Decrypts all files listed in manifest_file.
        This is the preferred decryption method.
    -d lockbox_dir
        Expert use only.  Decrypts all files in lockbox_dir, recursively, even
        if they were not originally encrypted.  If new plaintext files were
        added to lockbox_dir since it was encrypted, then this operation will
        corrupt them.  Please use '-d manifest_file' whenever possible.
    -h
        Display help information and exit.
    -v
        Display version information and exit.
    key
        Key to be used for encryption/decryption.
        Must be represented as a string comprised of exactly 64 hex characters,
        corresponding to a 256-bit (or 32-byte) key.
        Most easily generated by included gen_key.sh.

Example 1:
  Encrypt:
    ./lockbox.sh -e /tmp/lockbox aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa | tee manifest.txt
  Decrypt:
    ./lockbox.sh -d manifest.txt aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Example 2:
  Encrypt:
    ./lockbox.sh -e /tmp/lockbox $(xxd -p test.key | tr -d '\n') | tee manifest.txt
  Decrypt:
    ./lockbox.sh -d manifest.txt $(xxd -p test.key | tr -d '\n')
```


### Example usage
Running on a locally stored lockbox directory:
```
